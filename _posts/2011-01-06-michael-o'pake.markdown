excerpt: "On December 27, 2010, Pennsylvania state senator Mike O'Pake passed away at 70 years of age.  I know I'm going to miss seeing him at all types of community events, and I know everyone will miss his leadership, ideas, and willingness to always lend a hand to those in need."

On December 27, 2010, Pennsylvania state senator Mike O'Pake passed away at 70 years of age. This was very devastating for me and many local acquaintences due to how much Mike O'Pake held in our hearts. Unlike most politicians, he attended many local events to support his community, even though he had no obligation to do so. He always worked very hard for the people and, in addition to his political career, he was a neat person to talk to. Many claims support his backing of new political ideas to benefit the community, and he always worked to help people in need (and provide maps to everyone he met and coloring books and puzzles along with them). I know I'm going to miss seeing him at all types of community events, and I know everyone will miss his leadership, ideas, and willingness to always lend a hand to those in need.
